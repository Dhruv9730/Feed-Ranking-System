# ðŸ”¥ Feed Ranking System â€“ Real-Time Trending & Personalized Feeds

This project is a smart **Feed Ranking System** built using core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
It mimics how real platforms like **Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Twitter** rank and display trending posts.

It supports:
- âœ… Global Trending Feed (Top N posts in last 24h)
- âœ… Personalized Feed (Top posts interacted with by a user)
- âœ… Time-decay logic (recent > old)
- âœ… Quality scoring (likes-to-comments ratio)
- âœ… Max Heap for Top-K ranking

## ðŸ§  Why This Project?

Modern social platforms show **millions of posts**, but only the *most relevant* ones rise to the top.  
This project demonstrates how to:
- Rank content based on **freshness + engagement**
- Use **DSA to solve real business problems**
- Apply **heap, hashmap, sliding window, scoring logic** in production-style thinking
